Common Naming Conventions

paymentInstruction

Either is valid XML, but the usual conventions:
    If you want a direct mapping from the Java field name paymentInstruction, use paymentInstruction (preserves camelCase).
    If you follow XML element-name conventions that prefer PascalCase (common in some schemas like SOAP/WSDL or .NET interop), use PaymentInstruction.


Common JSON conventions:

    camelCase: paymentInstruction — most common for JavaScript/Java clients.
    PascalCase: PaymentInstruction — used when matching .NET styles or certain APIs.
    snake_case: payment_instruction — common in Python/Ruby eco-systems.
    kebab-case: payment-instruction — allowed but less common (hyphens require quoting).
